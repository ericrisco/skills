# Design — Product UI, Landing Pages & Conversion Copy

*Research the best current work, then ship a premium, accessible, fast, high-converting interface.*

## When to use / When NOT to use

Use when:

- Building a new landing or marketing page.
- Doing a redesign or a polish pass on an existing surface.
- Writing hero, value-prop, pricing, or FAQ copy.
- Choosing a visual system: type, color, spacing, radius, shadow, motion.
- Rescuing a UI that "feels generic / AI-slop".
- Running pre-launch design QA.

Do NOT use when (delegate or decline):

- Pure backend/data/infra work with no UI surface → decline; there is nothing to design.
- Dense internal operational tooling used daily (not a sales page) → apply product-domain judgment and do NOT force a landing composition (the *frontend-design-direction* lens, an external reference — not a repo skill).
- Native iOS/SwiftUI Liquid Glass material → the *liquid-glass-design* reference (external; this skill ships the *web* glass approximation only).
- Deep motion code mechanics (springs, `AnimatePresence` internals, layout animations) → the *motion-ui* / *motion-foundations* references (external; this skill sets motion *intent + budget*).
- Deep keyword research, GEO, or a technical SEO audit → the `../marketing/SKILL.md` sibling (it owns SEO-aware structure + keyword/intent; this skill only enforces SEO-aware *structure* in markup).

**Tool vs. landing page:** A SaaS operations tool should be dense, quiet, and scannable — never paint a marketing skin on a tool that needs repeated daily use.

## Brand grounding (read this first)

Before producing ANY landing / web-page / marketing output, ground in the project's brand study. A design with no brand behind it is a guess, and a guess defaults to your AI-generic prior. This step is mandatory and self-reinforcing: **an incomplete brand study is a hard stop, not a warning.**

Follow the harness 02-DOCS convention (brand study = wiki articles under `02-DOCS/wiki/brand/`, raw inputs under `02-DOCS/raw/brand/`, linked from root `CLAUDE.md`):

1. **Locate the brand study.** Read the project root `CLAUDE.md` and look for a `## Brand & voice` section pointing into `02-DOCS/wiki/brand/...`. If present, read those articles.
2. **If the link is MISSING, or the brand study is ABSENT or INCOMPLETE** (any checklist dimension empty), STOP. Do not design yet. Instead:
   - Ask the user the targeted question script — **ONE focused batch at a time**, not a wall of questions — until every dimension in the completeness checklist is filled. (→ `references/brand-grounding.md`)
   - Write/update the brand study into `02-DOCS/wiki/brand/` (and paste any raw inputs the user gives — screenshots, existing palettes, competitor lists — into `02-DOCS/raw/brand/`), following the wiki article format, and update `wiki/index.md` + `wiki/log.md`.
   - Add/update a `## Brand & voice` section in the root `CLAUDE.md` linking to it (create `CLAUDE.md` if absent).
3. **Only once the brand study exists and is sufficient, proceed** — and cite which brand articles drove which decisions in your output (e.g. "palette from `02-DOCS/wiki/brand/visual-identity.md`").

The completeness checklist spans visual identity (OKLCH color system, type pairing & scale, logo, imagery/illustration mood, density, radius/shadow/motion personality), reference/inspiration sites the user loves, layout preferences, dark-mode stance, accessibility & performance constraints, and brand voice/positioning (so copy and design agree). Full checklist + exact question script → `references/brand-grounding.md`.

The order is: **brand grounding → trend research → build.** If the brand study lacks aesthetic direction, or the user asks for "modern" / "2026" / "premium", run the research-first protocol (below) and fold current, cited findings into the output.

## The non-negotiables

These are constraints, not preferences. Violating any one is a defect, not a style choice.

1. **Ground in the brand study before you design.** No `02-DOCS/wiki/brand/` study, or an incomplete one → STOP and complete it. (→ "Brand grounding" above, `references/brand-grounding.md`)
2. **Research before you prescribe.** Run the research protocol; never ship from stale memory — your default taste skews AI-generic. Pull current 2026 trends with citations + dates. (→ `references/research-method.md`, `references/trends-2026.md`)
3. **5-second value prop.** What it is, who it's for, and why it's better must be legible above the fold in 5 seconds.
4. **One `<h1>` per page;** semantic landmarks (`header`/`nav`/`main`/`section`/`footer`).
5. **Core Web Vitals are design constraints:** LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1. (INP replaced FID in March 2024 — measure INP.)
6. **WCAG 2.2 AA:** 4.5:1 text contrast (3:1 large text / UI), visible focus, `prefers-reduced-motion` honored. Target size: 24×24px is the AA floor (SC 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum)); 44×44px is the recommended quality bar (Apple HIG / pointer comfort) — aim for 44, never ship below 24.
7. **Design tokens, never magic numbers.** Tailwind v4 `@theme` → CSS vars.
8. **Spacing on a 4/8px scale; type on a modular scale; color allocated 60-30-10.**
9. **Motion must guide attention, communicate state, or preserve continuity** — else delete it.
10. **Copy is benefit-led and specific.** No hype; the ban-list is enforced. (→ `references/copywriting-frameworks.md`)
11. **Match the product domain.** Density and composition follow the audience and the job, not a template.

## Decision rules (pick a direction first)

Fill the direction brief before you write a single line of markup:

```text
DIRECTION BRIEF (fill before coding)
1. Purpose .......... what job does this interface do, in one sentence?
2. Audience ......... who repeats this workflow; what do they scan first?
3. Tone ............. pick: utilitarian | editorial | playful | industrial | refined | technical | minimal | dense | calm
4. Memorable detail . the ONE idea that makes it feel intentional (not a gradient)
5. Constraints ...... framework, a11y, perf budget, existing design system/tokens
```

Then map the project type to composition, density, and motion budget:

| Project type | Composition | Density | Motion budget |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SaaS marketing | Full landing stack, hero→CTA | Generous | Tasteful reveals, hover affordances |
| Dev tool | Show the product/CLI first, then proof | Medium | Subtle, fast (≤200ms) |
| Dashboard / internal tool | Data-first, no hero | Dense, scannable | State-only (loading, success) |
| Portfolio / editorial | Expressive, asymmetric | Airy | Expressive but reduced-motion-safe |
| E-commerce | Product grid, fast PDP | Medium | Micro-interactions on add-to-cart |
| Docs | Sidebar + reading column | Calm, 65ch measure | Near-zero |

## Research-first protocol

Trends churn quarterly and your built-in aesthetic prior is the median of every AI template ever scraped. Counter it with a loop:

1. Define 2–3 reference archetypes from the DIRECTION BRIEF (e.g. "Linear-grade dev tool, dark, type-led").
2. WebSearch award galleries and tier-1 product sites: `awwwards.com`, `godly.website`, `land-book.com`, `mobbin.com`, Refactoring UI, and the tier-1 sites (Linear, Stripe, Vercel, Cursor, Resend).
3. WebFetch 3–5 exemplars, prompting each for type, color, layout, motion, and copy voice — concrete details, not adjectives.
4. Extract a pattern table from what they share and where they differ.
5. Synthesize a one-paragraph DESIGN DIRECTION with citations (which URL contributed what).
6. Only THEN build; re-check the result against the references in QA.

Re-research per project — trends churn, competitors moved, and the domain dictates the reference set. Do not rely on stale memory: whenever the brand study lacks aesthetic direction or the user asks for "modern" / "2026" / "premium", WebSearch/WebFetch current trends (award sites, Linear/Stripe/Vercel/Resend-tier, current type/color/motion/layout moves), fold the findings into the output **with citations + dates**, and refresh `references/trends-2026.md`. Full loop, source map, and synthesis template → `references/research-method.md`. Current snapshot (dated, cited) → `references/trends-2026.md`.

## Visual system in 90 seconds

Copy-pasteable foundation. Tokens once, consume everywhere.

- Tailwind v4 `@theme` block (OKLCH): tokens become CSS vars and utilities automatically — no `tailwind.config.js`.
- Type scale via `next/font` (one display + one text face) plus a fluid `clamp()` ladder.
- Spacing, radius, and shadow are tokens too, never inline numbers.
- The rule: arbitrary hex + random px = Bad; token references = Good.

```css
/* Good — Tailwind v4 @theme: OKLCH palette, tokens become CSS vars + utilities */
@import "tailwindcss";
@theme {
  --color-bg:        oklch(0.99 0 0);
  --color-fg:        oklch(0.21 0.01 256);
  --color-muted:     oklch(0.55 0.01 256);
  --color-brand-500: oklch(0.62 0.19 256);
  --color-brand-600: oklch(0.55 0.19 256);
  --font-display:    "Geist", ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif;
  --font-text:       "Inter", ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif;
  --radius-card:     0.875rem;
  --shadow-card:     0 1px 2px oklch(0 0 0 / 0.06), 0 8px 24px oklch(0 0 0 / 0.08);
  --ease-out:        cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1);
}
```

```html
<!-- Bad — magic hex + arbitrary px, no system -->
<div style="background:#5b54ff;border-radius:13px;padding:17px">…</div>
<!-- Good — token-driven utilities -->
<div class="bg-brand-500 rounded-card p-4">…</div>
```

## Landing page build recipe ("the brutal landing")

Each section has ONE job. Cut any section that has none.

1. **Hero** — state the value prop; pass the 5s test.
2. **Social-proof strip** — borrow credibility immediately (logos, a hard metric).
3. **Problem / agitation** — name the pain in the reader's words.
4. **Solution** — show the product doing the job.
5. **Features → benefits (bento)** — translate each capability into an outcome.
6. **Objection handling** — preempt the top reason they won't buy.
7. **Pricing** — anchor, highlight one tier, default to annual.
8. **FAQ** — answer the real blockers, not filler.
9. **Final CTA** — one clear action, value on the button.
10. **Footer** — navigation, legal, trust signals.

```tsx
// app/page.tsx — Server Component, LCP-safe hero (Next.js 15 / React 19)
import Image from "next/image";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <main>
      <section className="mx-auto max-w-5xl px-6 pt-24 text-center">
        <h1 className="text-balance text-5xl font-semibold tracking-tight md:text-6xl">
          Ship the change in an afternoon, not a sprint
        </h1>
        <p className="mx-auto mt-5 max-w-xl text-pretty text-lg text-fg/70">
          Concrete benefit, who it is for, and why now — no hype.
        </p>
        <a
          href="#start"
          className="mt-8 inline-flex min-h-11 items-center rounded-card bg-brand-500 px-6 font-medium text-white transition-colors hover:bg-brand-600"
        >
          Start free
        </a>
        <Image
          src="/hero.avif"
          alt="Product dashboard showing a one-click deploy"
          width={1200}
          height={720}
          priority
          className="mt-16 rounded-card shadow-card"
        />
      </section>
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Conversion copy in one pass

- The 5s value-prop test: a stranger reads the hero and can say what it is, who it's for, why it's better.
- Headline formula slots: outcome + timeframe; "X without Y"; the job-to-be-done.
- Framework picker: PAS for pain-aware cold traffic; AIDA for broad / top-of-funnel; FAB/JTBD for feature → benefit translation.
- CTA: put the value on the button ("Start free", "Get my estimate"), never "Submit".

```text
Bad  — "Revolutionize your workflow with our seamless platform"
Good — "Deploy a fix in 4 minutes — no YAML, no on-call page"
```

Ban: `revolutionary` · `game-changer` · `cutting-edge` · "In today's landscape" · `unlock` · `seamless` · `elevate` · `supercharge` · bait questions · "not X, just Y" · forced lowercase · "Excited to share".

Frameworks, value-prop canvas, Bad→Good rewrites, VOICE block → `references/copywriting-frameworks.md`.

## Motion & interaction budget

- Purposeful-only: motion must guide attention, communicate state, or preserve continuity.
- Timing defaults: enter 200–350ms, exit ~150ms, press `scale(0.97)`.
- Never `transition: all` — it animates layout props and janks.
- Compositor-only properties: `transform`, `opacity`, `filter`.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` is required, not optional.
- Scroll-driven via native CSS `animation-timeline: view()` FIRST (no JS, no CLS) before any JS library.

```css
/* Good — native scroll-driven reveal, zero JS, explicit @supports fallback */
.reveal { opacity: 1; } /* default visible: no scroll-timeline support => never hidden */
@supports (animation-timeline: view()) {
  @media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
    .reveal {
      animation: reveal linear both;
      animation-timeline: view();
      animation-range: entry 0% cover 30%;
    }
  }
}
@keyframes reveal {
  from { opacity: 0; translate: 0 16px; }
  to   { opacity: 1; translate: 0 0; }
}
```

## Premium details that compound

Small things, applied consistently, are what reads as "designed".

| Detail | Bad | Good |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nested radius | Same radius parent + child | `outer = inner + padding` (concentric) |
| Shadows | One hard `0 4px 8px #000` | Layered transparent OKLCH shadows |
| Separation | Heavy drop shadow everywhere | Hairline 1px border first, shadow only for lift |
| Headings | Ragged wrap | `text-wrap: balance` |
| Body / captions | Orphan last word | `text-wrap: pretty` |
| Numbers/prices | Width jitters | `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` |
| Images | Edge blurs into bg | 1px neutral `outline`, `outline-offset: -1px` |
| Glass | `backdrop-blur` on everything | Blur + 1px hairline + subtle noise, sparingly |

```css
html { -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale; }
img  { outline: 1px solid oklch(0 0 0 / 0.1); outline-offset: -1px; }
.price { font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; }
```

Depth recipes, glass, noise, concentric math → `references/visual-system.md`.

## Anti-patterns / rationalizations → STOP

| Rationalization | Reality / Fix |
| --- | --- |
| "Purple→blue gradient on everything looks modern" | It reads AI-generic. Pick a domain-true palette; gradients are seasoning. |
| "Centered text over an atmospheric gradient is a hero" | Show the product. Vague hero fails the 5s test. |
| "Cards inside cards add structure" | They add noise. Flatten; use spacing + one border. |
| "I know good design, I'll skip research" | Taste ≠ current trend. Re-research every project. |
| "The image sells it, copy can be vague" | Copy carries the value prop. Pass the 5s test. |
| "Animate everything on scroll" | CLS + INP cost. Reveal sparingly, transform/opacity only. |
| "Ship now, check contrast later" | Contrast is a constraint, not polish. 4.5:1 or it ships broken. |
| "Glass everywhere looks premium" | Glass on everything looks cheap. Reserve for floating surfaces. |
| "`transition: all` is convenient" | It animates layout props → jank. List exact properties. |

## Quick reference

| Lever | Default | Token / where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Type scale ratio | 1.25 | modular scale |
| Body size | 16–18px | `--font-text` |
| Line-height | 1.5 body / 1.1 display | per element |
| Spacing base | 4 / 8px | Tailwind spacing |
| Color allocation | 60-30-10 | bg / fg / brand |
| Text contrast | ≥ 4.5:1 (3:1 large) | verify with checker |
| Card radius | 0.875rem | `--radius-card` |
| Touch target | 44×44px recommended; 24×24px AA floor (SC 2.5.8) | `min-h-11` |
| Enter / exit motion | 250ms / 150ms | `--ease-out` |
| LCP | < 2.5s | `next/image priority` |
| INP | < 200ms | compositor-only motion |
| CLS | < 0.1 | reserved space, `next/font` |
| Hero | passes 5s test | value prop above fold |

## Design-review QA checklist

Run before claiming done. Same checks `scripts/verify.sh` falls back to.

- [ ] Value prop legible in 5 seconds above the fold.
- [ ] Text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (3:1 for large text / UI).
- [ ] Visible focus state on all interactive elements.
- [ ] Touch targets 44×44px (recommended); never below the 24×24px WCAG 2.2 AA floor (SC 2.5.8).
- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion` honored.
- [ ] Exactly one `<h1>` on the page.
- [ ] Semantic landmarks present (`header`/`nav`/`main`/`section`/`footer`).
- [ ] LCP image has `priority`.
- [ ] Fonts use `next/font` (no CLS / FOUT swap shift).
- [ ] No `transition: all` / `transition-all`.
- [ ] Tokens used (no magic hex / px).
- [ ] Ban-list words absent from copy.
- [ ] Text fits at 360px and desktop without overflow.
- [ ] Empty / loading / hover / error states designed.

Automate → `scripts/verify.sh` (runs Lighthouse if a dev server is up, else static grep checks + this list).

### Optional: graded visual-audit rubric (0–10)

The checklist above is pass/fail. When the user asks for a *design review*, a *critique*, or a quality grade — or when you want to argue a surface is genuinely premium rather than merely compliant — score these 10 dimensions 0–10 and report the weighted total. Pass/fail tells you it ships; the rubric tells you how good it is.

| # | Dimension | What a 10 looks like | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | First impression & value clarity | Passes the 5s test instantly; product shown, not a gradient | 1.5 |
| 2 | Typographic craft | Modular scale, ≤2 families, balanced headings, 45–75ch measure, tabular numerals | 1.0 |
| 3 | Color & contrast | Disciplined 60-30-10 OKLCH system, all text ≥ 4.5:1, dark mode via token swap | 1.0 |
| 4 | Layout & spacing rhythm | Consistent 4/8px scale, intentional asymmetry/bento, clear focal point | 1.0 |
| 5 | Hierarchy & scannability | Eye lands in the right order; one primary action per viewport | 1.0 |
| 6 | Depth & detail polish | Concentric radius, layered shadows, hairline borders, restrained glass | 1.0 |
| 7 | Motion quality | Purposeful only, compositor-only props, reduced-motion + `@supports` guards | 1.0 |
| 8 | Accessibility | Landmarks, one `<h1>`, visible focus, 24px+ targets (44 ideal), no motion-only meaning | 1.0 |
| 9 | Performance (CWV) | LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1; LCP image `priority`, `next/font` | 1.0 |
| 10 | Copy & brand fidelity | Benefit-led, specific, ban-list clean, voice matches the `02-DOCS/wiki/brand/` study | 0.5 |

Score = Σ(dimension × weight), max 100. **Bands:** < 60 ships generic — redo; 60–79 competent but improvable — name the lowest two and fix; 80–94 premium; 95+ award-tier. For each dimension below 8, give one concrete, actionable fix (not "improve spacing" but "section padding jumps 48→96px with no 64px step — add `py-16` on mobile"). Cite the brand article or trend source that sets the bar where relevant.

## Project grounding (02-DOCS + CLAUDE.md)

This skill's 02-DOCS record has two parts, both indexed from a `## Knowledge map` section in
the root `CLAUDE.md`:

- The **brand study** at `02-DOCS/wiki/brand/` — a hard gate (see "Brand grounding" above): if
  missing or incomplete, ask until complete before designing.
- The **design-system decisions** at `02-DOCS/wiki/stack/design.md` — the chosen tokens
  (color/OKLCH, type scale, spacing, radius, shadow, motion), the 2026 direction picked, and the
  reference sites. Recorded, not gated.

Create/update both as decisions are made and add/refresh their `CLAUDE.md` links (create the
`## Knowledge map` section, and `CLAUDE.md` itself, if absent). Read them first on every use and
keep outputs consistent with them.
