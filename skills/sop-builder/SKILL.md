# SOP builder

You keep re-explaining the same process. Write it down once, correctly, so it
runs without you. That is the whole job: take a workflow living in one person's
head, a Slack thread, or a screen recording, and turn it into a **standard
operating procedure** — a document another human or agent can follow to get the
same result every time.

An SOP is not a meeting note and not a project plan. Hold the line:

- **What was decided + who does what by when** → [`meeting-notes`](../meeting-notes/SKILL.md). That records a moment; you record a *recurring task*.
- **Milestones, status, a thing with an end date** → [`project-ops`](../project-ops/SKILL.md). A project finishes; an SOP repeats forever.
- **External help-center docs / product manuals** → [`technical-writing`](../technical-writing/SKILL.md). That writes for a customer; you write for the person inside the org who runs the routine.
- **Regulated GxP quality-system SOPs with formal approval + audit trail** → [`compliance`](../compliance/SKILL.md) owns the regulatory gating. You write the operational document; defer the sign-off framework to them.
- **Turning the documented steps into a flow / webhook / script** → [`automation-flows`](../automation-flows/SKILL.md). You document; they automate.
- **One specific new hire's first-week checklist + accounts** → [`people-ops`](../people-ops/SKILL.md). You write the *reusable* procedure they'll follow, not their personal tracker.

The payoff is real but conditional: standardizing a process can cut errors by
up to ~90% — **only when the SOP is clear and easy to follow**. A correct SOP
nobody can read changes nothing. Usability is the whole game.

## The capture-to-SOP loop

This is the spine. Run it in order; do not skip the test step.

1. **Pick one process.** One trigger in, one defined output out. If you can't
   name the trigger and the output, you're scoping a department, not an SOP.
2. **Capture the real flow** — interview the owner *or* read their recording/
   transcript. Capture how it actually runs, not how it's supposed to.
3. **Find the decisions and exceptions.** Where does it fork? Where does it
   break when the owner is out? These are what a linear draft will miss.
4. **Choose the format by flow shape** (next section). Linear ≠ branching ≠
   parallel, and each wants a different shape.
5. **Draft at the right altitude** — who does what and when, not every keystroke.
6. **Test it on someone who has never done the task.** If they get stuck or ask
   a question, the SOP has a gap — fix the document, not the person.
7. **Assign an accountable owner and a review date.** Unowned, undated SOPs are
   dead on arrival.

Steps 3 and 6 are the ones teams skip and the reason most SOPs fail in the
wild — a happy-path document breaks the moment reality forks.

## Scope the right altitude

An SOP and a work instruction are different documents. Per ISO 9001:2015 a
procedure is "a specified way to carry out an activity." Don't bloat an SOP with
keystroke detail — that's a separate work instruction, and one SOP links to
several of them.

| Altitude | Answers | Example line | Belongs in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SOP | *who* does *what* and *when* (the roadmap) | "The editor approves the draft before it's scheduled." | The SOP body |
| Work instruction | *how* one operator does one task (the GPS) | "Click Settings → Schedule → pick 09:00, hit Confirm." | A linked WI, not inline |

Rule of thumb: if removing a line wouldn't change *who* is accountable or *what*
the next decision is, it's probably a keystroke — link it out or cut it. A
reader who already knows the tool should not have to scroll past click-by-click
detail to find the one decision that matters.

## Pick the format by flow shape

Match format to the shape of the work, not to preference. A mismatched format is
a top adoption killer — people abandon an SOP that fights how the task actually
moves.

| Flow shape | Use | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Strictly linear, every time the same | Numbered step-by-step | The order *is* the procedure; numbers carry it. |
| Many parallel pieces, done by experienced people | Checklist | They know *how*; they need to not forget a piece, not be walked through it. |
| Has decision points / forks / "it depends" | Flowchart or decision table | A numbered list hides branches inside prose and readers miss them. |

If the process has even one real "if X then Y" fork, do **not** force it into a
flat numbered list. The fork is exactly the part that breaks under pressure, and
a flat list buries it.

## The capture step

Garbage in, garbage SOP. Capture how the work *actually* runs.

**From a recording (the fast path).** A team hand-writing one SOP spends ~3–5
hours; recording the task once (10–15 min) and extracting steps from the
video/transcript is reported 10–20x faster. Treat the recording as the single
source of truth, then prune to the SOP. Crucially: **do not invent steps the
source never shows.** If the transcript skips a step, flag the gap — don't
backfill it from imagination.

**From an interview**, surface the hidden branches with probes the owner won't
volunteer:

- "Walk me through the last time you did this, start to finish."
- "Where does this break when you're on holiday?" — the single best
  branch-finder; it surfaces the tacit knowledge that lives only in their head.
- "What's the most common thing that goes wrong, and what do you do then?"
- "When do you have to ask someone else before continuing?" (→ an escalation).
- "Is there a case where you skip a step or do it differently?" (→ a branch).

People who actually do the work must be in the capture loop. An SOP written
*about* people instead of *with* them is the classic reason it goes unfollowed.
The full 10–12 question interview script is in
[`references/sop-skeleton.md`](references/sop-skeleton.md).

## The SOP skeleton

Four sections are load-bearing and appear in essentially every credible
template: **purpose, scope, responsibilities, procedure**. Everything else is
supporting structure. Mark sections mandatory vs optional-by-size:

| Section | Status | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Title + ID/version | Mandatory | One process, one document. |
| Purpose | Mandatory | Why this exists, in one sentence. |
| Scope | Mandatory | What's in, what's out, when it triggers. |
| Owner (the "A" in RACI) | Mandatory | Exactly one accountable person. |
| Trigger | Mandatory | The event that starts the procedure. |
| Steps | Mandatory | The numbered/checklist/branched body. |
| Decision points | If it branches | The forks, written explicitly. |
| Quality check | Mandatory | How you know the output is correct. |
| Output | Mandatory | The defined thing produced. |
| Exceptions / escalation | If it can fail | What to do when it goes wrong. |
| RACI matrix | If >1 role | Only when the process spans roles. |
| Change log | Mandatory | Version, date, author, one-line what-changed. |
| Next-review date | Mandatory | See "Keep it alive". |

A RACI clarifies ownership when more than one role touches the process:
Responsible does it, Accountable owns the outcome (exactly one), Consulted gives
input, Informed is kept in the loop. A solo task does **not** need a matrix —
don't add ceremony the process doesn't carry. The full copy-paste template with
per-field guidance lives in
[`references/sop-skeleton.md`](references/sop-skeleton.md).

## Write it so it's actually used

SOPs go unfollowed because of the document, not the people: lack of clarity,
cognitive overload from length and jargon, and staleness. Under pressure people
default to memory over a wall of text. So write short, active, and concrete.

- **One action per step.** Two verbs in a step means a reader can do half and
  think they're done.
- **Active voice, named actor.** Who does it must be unambiguous.
- **No internal jargon** the next hire won't know — or define it once.

Bad → Good:

```markdown
Bad:  The newsletter should be reviewed and then it gets scheduled, making
      sure that everything is fine before it goes out.
Good: 1. Editor reviews the draft against the checklist in §4.
      2. Editor schedules the approved draft for 09:00 Tuesday.
      3. Editor confirms the send shows in the queue.
```

The bad version hides three actions, names no actor, and uses passive voice that
lets everyone assume someone else did the check.

## Branches and exceptions — the section people skip

Branching logic, exceptions/escalations, and the change log are the three
sections SOPs most often omit, and the reason they fail in production. Write the
fork explicitly; don't bury it in prose.

```markdown
Step 4 — Check the invoice total.
  - If total ≤ €1,000 → approve and proceed to Step 5.
  - If total > €1,000 → route to Finance lead for sign-off, then Step 5.
  - If the PO number is missing → STOP. Escalate to <owner>; do not approve.
```

Every exception needs a named escalation target and a clear stop condition. "If
unsure, ask someone" is not an escalation — name the role and the trigger. You
don't need a sprawling flowchart for three forks; inline `if X then Y` lines are
enough until the branch count makes a decision table or flowchart clearer (see
"Pick the format").

## Keep it alive

An SOP without an owner and a review date is already dead. Every SOP carries:

- **One accountable owner** — the person who answers for the outcome.
- **A change log** — version, date, author, one line on what changed. Without
  it, nobody trusts which version is current.
- **A next-review date.** Reviews are annual minimum *plus* trigger-based: after
  a process or tool change, after an incident, or after an audit.

Treat an SOP unreviewed for **18+ months as unreliable** — it likely describes a
process that no longer exists. When the review fires, re-run the capture loop on
the diff, not the whole document.

For **regulated** quality systems (GxP, formal approval workflows, audit-trail
sign-off), write the operational content here and hand the approval/gating
framework to [`compliance`](../compliance/SKILL.md). Once the SOP is stable and
you want the steps executed automatically, hand it to
[`automation-flows`](../automation-flows/SKILL.md).

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | Do instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Keystroke-level SOP ("click Settings, then…") | Bloats the doc; rots the day the UI changes | Keep SOP at who/what/when; link work instructions |
| Flat numbered list for a branching process | Hides the forks that break under pressure | Use a decision table / flowchart for branches |
| Happy-path only, no exceptions | Breaks the first time reality forks | Write `if X then Y` + a named escalation |
| No owner, no review date | Goes stale silently, nobody trusts it | Name one accountable owner + a next-review date |
| Written *about* the doer, not *with* them | Misses tacit steps; gets ignored | Interview/record the person who runs it |
| Inventing steps the recording never showed | Ships a procedure that doesn't match reality | Flag gaps; capture the missing step, don't guess |
| Wall of passive-voice prose | Cognitive overload; people fall back to memory | One action per step, active voice, named actor |
| RACI on a solo task | Ceremony the process doesn't carry | Add a matrix only when >1 role touches it |

Pull the full fill-in template, the 10–12 question capture interview script, the
format-selection decision table, and a complete worked Bad→Good example SOP from
[`references/sop-skeleton.md`](references/sop-skeleton.md). Keep this body lean;
reach for the template when you're actually drafting.
