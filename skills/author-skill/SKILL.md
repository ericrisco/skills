# author-skill — write skills that trigger and teach

This is the **meta skill**: it authors and edits the other skills in the rsc catalog. A skill is two things bolted together — a **description that fires at the right moment**, and a **body that makes the agent better once it fires**. Most skills fail on the first. This skill exists to get both right, to the bar the rsc catalog already holds.

It lives in `rsc-core` next to `init` and `harness`, the same way those govern the workspace. Where the SDD chain (`specify` → `plan` → … → `ship`) builds *product*, `author-skill` builds *the tools that build product*. Use it whenever a skill is born or edited.

## When to use / when NOT to use

Use when:

- Writing a brand-new skill from a one-line intent ("I keep re-explaining how we do X — make it a skill").
- Editing an existing skill: tightening the description, splitting the body into `references/`, adding a checklist or anti-patterns table.
- A skill mis-triggers — never fires when it should, or fires on everything.
- Writing or repairing `evals/cases.yaml` + `evals/README.md`.
- Wiring a finished skill into the catalog — `tags`, `recommends`, and the manifest (the rsc plumbing).
- Auditing a skill against the rubric below before it ships.

Do NOT use when (delegate or decline):

- The user wants to *build a product feature* with a written spec/plan — that is the SDD chain (`../specify/SKILL.md` → `../plan/SKILL.md` → …), not a skill.
- The user wants to design an autonomous agent / tool-calling loop — that is `../building-agents/SKILL.md`.
- The user wants generic project docs or a wiki article — that is the `../harness/SKILL.md` 02-DOCS engine.
- Bootstrapping a workspace or profiling the user — that is `../init/SKILL.md`.

## Read the user profile first (accompaniment dial)

Before writing, read `02-DOCS/wiki/harness/user-profile.md` for the technical level and the accompaniment dial, and **adapt**:

- **L0** — draft the whole skill, show it, move on. Minimal narration.
- **L1** — one line of *why* per major choice (why this trigger, why split that reference).
- **L2** — justify each structural decision as you make it.
- **L3** — explain everything, ask before committing to a name/scope, walk the rubric out loud.

When no profile exists, default to non-technical framing and ask the two gauging questions (technical level + dial) before going deep. Skill authoring is itself a technical act — many users will want L2/L3 here even if they run L0 elsewhere.

## What a skill is (the anatomy)

```text
skills/<id>/
├── SKILL.md              the body: frontmatter (name + description + origin) then the prose
├── references/           progressive-disclosure detail, loaded only when the body points to it
│   └── <topic>.md
├── evals/
│   ├── cases.yaml        trigger + capability test cases
│   └── README.md         how to run the evals, honestly
└── scripts/              optional; verify.sh + helpers for skills with a checkable artifact
    └── verify.sh
```

The **frontmatter** decides *if* the skill loads. The **body** decides *how good* the agent is once it does. Treat them as two separate engineering problems with two separate quality bars.

## The description — the single highest-leverage line

The description is the only part of a skill the agent reads at *every* turn to decide whether to pull the skill in. A vague description is a skill that never fires; an over-broad one is a skill that hijacks unrelated turns. Get this right before anything else.

Rules, all enforced:

1. **Third person, present tense.** "Use when authoring a new skill…" — never "I help you…" or "You should…". The agent is reading *about* the skill.
2. **Trigger-rich.** Lead with a `Use when …` clause naming the *situations* and *symptoms*, then a `Triggers:` list of concrete phrasings — including non-obvious ones and at least one other language the user actually writes in (rsc users mix Spanish/Catalan). The router matches on these.
3. **Draw the boundary.** End with what it is **NOT** and which sibling owns that instead. Negative space prevents hijacking as much as positive triggers cause firing.
4. **≤ 1024 characters, valid single-line quoted YAML.** One physical line, wrapped in double quotes, internal quotes escaped or avoided. If it does not parse, the skill does not load.
5. **`origin: risco`** on its own line. This marks it as ours.

```yaml
# Good — situation + symptoms + phrasings + boundary
description: "Use when X happens or the user shows symptom Y — doing A, fixing B, choosing C. Triggers: 'phrase one', 'frase en español', 'a non-obvious one'. NOT Z (that is `sibling`)."

# Bad — first person, no triggers, no boundary, would never route well
description: "I help you write great skills and make them work."
```

The full description recipe, the character-budget tactics, and a worked before/after → `references/description-recipe.md`.

## Progressive disclosure — the body is an index, not an encyclopedia

The body is loaded in full whenever the skill fires, so every line competes for the agent's attention. Keep the body **~120–400 lines**: the method, the rules, the decision points, and *pointers* to depth. Push anything long, reference-like, or rarely-needed into `references/<topic>.md` and link to it inline ("full table → `references/foo.md`").

Decide where a paragraph lives:

| Put it in the body when… | Move it to references/ when… |
| --- | --- |
| The agent needs it on *every* run | It is needed only in a specific branch |
| It is a rule, a gate, or a decision point | It is a long table, a catalog, or a template |
| It is short and load-bearing | It is reference detail that would bloat the body |
| Cutting it would change behavior | It is an example that illustrates but does not instruct |

If the body creeps past ~400 lines, that is the signal to extract a reference — not to keep scrolling. A skill the agent half-reads is worse than a short one it reads fully.

## The hybrid structure — when each piece earns its place

- **SKILL.md** — always. Frontmatter + focused body.
- **references/** — only when the body genuinely needs offloaded depth. Do not create an empty `references/` to look complete; a 150-line single-file skill is fine.
- **evals/** — always. `cases.yaml` + `README.md`. A skill with no evals is unverifiable and does not ship.
- **scripts/verify.sh** — only when the skill produces a *checkable artifact* (code, config, copy with a ban-list). **Process skills** — those judged on the safety rails they install in the agent's behavior, like the SDD-phase skills or this one — do **not** ship a `verify.sh`; their evals carry a capability scenario instead.

## The authoring workflow

Run in order. Each step gates the next.

1. **Name & scope.** One skill, one job. Pick a short kebab-case `<id>` that is the job, not the domain. If you can not say the job in one sentence, the scope is wrong — split it. Check no sibling already owns this; if one half-owns it, decide *edit the sibling* vs *new skill* before writing.
2. **Draft the description.** Per the recipe above. This first, because writing it forces the scope clear. → `references/description-recipe.md`.
3. **Outline the body.** Method, rules, decision points. Mark what becomes a reference.
4. **Write the body** in the rsc voice (see below). Tag every code/example fence with a language. Add a copy-able checklist or decision table *only where the flow actually branches* — not as decoration. Add a short anti-patterns table.
5. **Extract references** for anything long or branch-specific.
6. **Write the evals** — `cases.yaml` then `README.md`. → `references/eval-authoring.md`.
7. **Wire it into the rsc plumbing** (`tags`, `recommends`, `npm run manifest`, Knowledge map). → `references/rsc-conventions.md`.
8. **Self-audit against the rubric** (below). Fix every miss or justify it.

## The rsc voice

Match the catalog, do not invent a new register:

- Direct, second-person-to-the-agent instruction ("Read the profile first", "Cut any section with no job").
- Rules stated as non-negotiables with a one-line *why*, not a lecture.
- Concrete over abstract: a number, a path, a Bad→Good pair beats an adjective.
- Original prose. Mine ideas from anywhere; the words are Eric's. Do **not** reproduce another ecosystem's signature artifacts or phrasing — no borrowed "1% chance" urgency blocks, no copied rationalization wording, no `*-reviewer-prompt.md` files, no verbatim flowcharts. The rsc identity is its own.
- Cross-reference siblings by name or `../<sibling>/SKILL.md`, only ones that actually exist.

## The best-practice rubric (audit before shipping)

A skill ships only when every box is checked or a miss is consciously justified.

- [ ] **Frontmatter parses** as YAML; `name` matches the directory `<id>`; `origin: risco` present.
- [ ] **Description ≤ 1024 chars**, third-person, `Use when…` lead, concrete `Triggers:` (incl. a non-obvious and a non-English phrasing), and a `NOT … (that is sibling)` boundary.
- [ ] **One job.** The body never drifts into a second skill's territory; it delegates instead.
- [ ] **Body 120–400 lines**, focused; long/branch-specific material lives in `references/`.
- [ ] **Progressive disclosure** real — references are pointed to inline, not orphaned.
- [ ] **Every fence language-tagged**; no placeholder/TODO prose; examples concrete.
- [ ] **Checklist/decision table only where a flow branches**; an **anti-patterns table** present.
- [ ] **Accompaniment dial honored** — reads the profile, adapts verbosity.
- [ ] **Artifacts under `02-DOCS/wiki/`** and indexed in the root CLAUDE.md Knowledge map, if the skill produces any.
- [ ] **Concrete tooling delegated** to the stack skills rather than reinvented.
- [ ] **evals present** — `cases.yaml` (≥5 `should_trigger` incl. non-obvious, ≥4 `should_not_trigger` each with a real-sibling `route_to`, ≥1 `capability` with a `must_include` rubric) + an honest `README.md`. `scripts/eval-lint.sh` passes — but it only checks presence and the counts (≥5/≥4/≥1) and that those keys are lists; the `route_to`-points-at-a-real-sibling, non-obvious phrasings, and `must_include` quality are yours to verify here, not the linter's.
- [ ] **verify.sh** present iff the skill has a checkable artifact; process skills rely on evals.
- [ ] **Sibling links resolve** — every `../x/SKILL.md` points to a skill that exists.
- [ ] **Wired** — `tags` + `recommends` set, `npm run manifest` re-run, and `npm run validate` / `npm run manifest:check` pass (manifest current, no dangling recommends).

## Anti-patterns / rationalizations → STOP

| Rationalization | Reality / fix |
| --- | --- |
| "I'll polish the description later, the body matters more" | The description is *why the body ever runs*. Write it first, to bar. |
| "More triggers = fires more = better" | Over-broad descriptions hijack unrelated turns. Add the `NOT` boundary and prune. |
| "One skill that does specify + plan + implement is convenient" | One skill, one job. A multi-job skill triggers fuzzily and teaches poorly. Split it. |
| "The body is long because the topic is rich" | Past ~400 lines the agent skims. Extract references; keep the body an index. |
| "I'll skip evals, I'll just test it by hand once" | Unverifiable = does not ship. Write `cases.yaml`, including near-misses with `route_to`. |
| "It's basically superpowers' writing-skills, I'll mirror it" | Mine the idea, write it in the rsc voice. Copied artifacts/phrasing are a defect. |
| "I'll add a `references/` folder so it looks thorough" | Empty references are noise. Add depth only where the body points to it. |
| "verify.sh on every skill is more rigorous" | A process skill has no artifact to grep. Its rigor is the capability eval. |
| "Linking `../foo/SKILL.md` is fine even if foo isn't in this repo" | A dead link is a defect. Reference only siblings that exist. |

## Project grounding (02-DOCS + CLAUDE.md)

When authoring produces a durable design note (a skill's scope decision, a description rationale worth keeping), persist it under `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/` and add a row to the root CLAUDE.md `## Knowledge map`, per the `../harness/SKILL.md` convention — never a stray file at the repo root. The skill's own `evals/` is the executable record of intent; the wiki note is the human-readable why.
