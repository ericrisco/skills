# Specify — intent becomes a spec

This is the **specify** phase of the rsc-sdd chain: `constitution` → **`specify`** → `clarify` → `plan` → `tasks` → `analyze` → `implement` → `verify` → `review` → `ship`. Its single job is to turn a fuzzy intent into a written specification that states **WHAT** the change is and **WHY** it matters — and nothing about **HOW** it gets built.

A spec is a contract about behaviour and outcomes, readable by a non-technical stakeholder and precise enough that a `plan` can be derived from it. The output is one file: `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/specs/<slug>.md`, indexed in the root `CLAUDE.md` Knowledge map.

## Detect the moment — and hold the gate

Fire on the **faintest** sign the user is thinking about a new feature or change — not just "spec this", but any musing: "I want to add…", "can we build…", "it should also…", "wouldn't it be nice if…", "what if we…", "I've been thinking about…", "let's brainstorm…", "tengo una idea", "se me ha ocurrido", "¿y si…?", "estaría guapo que…", "quiero añadir…", "necesito que haga…". This phase owns that moment, *even if a stack skill (nextjs/fastapi/flutter…) also fired and is itching to build it*. Catch it here first — being too eager to brainstorm is cheap; skipping it is expensive.

**The hard gate — every feature, including the "obvious" ones:**
> No implementation starts — not a stack skill, not `plan`-to-code, not "just a quick version" — until the user has **approved a design** (the spec at step 9 below) and `plan` has produced the technical plan + task list. If the user says "just build it", do not; name the gate in one friendly line and run the loop. "Too simple to need a design" is the rationalization that wastes the most work — every feature gets the loop. The only thing that skips it is a literal one-line, zero-risk change (typo/copy/config) — say so out loud and do it.

You are not slowing them down; you make the intent reviewable *before* code exists, which is far cheaper than discovering the misunderstanding in a PR. End every spec by handing to `clarify`/`plan` — never to `implement`.

## The one rule that defines this skill

**No implementation leaks.** The moment the spec names a framework, a table schema, a library, an endpoint shape, a file path, or an algorithm, it has stopped being a spec. Those decisions belong to `plan` and the stack skills. Specify describes the *observable behaviour and the reason for it*; the system that delivers it is deliberately left open.

If you cannot describe a requirement without naming the technology, you have found a real question — record it as a point to clarify, do not guess the answer.

## Model tier — `balanced` (opt-in routing)

This phase's default model tier is **`balanced`** — it drafts the what/why spec through dialogue, not architecture. Routing is **off** unless `models.enabled: true` in `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/config.yaml`. When on: resolve this phase's tier (`models.overrides` wins over `models.phases`), map it to a model via `models.tiers`, and apply per `../sdd/references/model-routing.md` — announce the switch per the accompaniment dial when it differs from the session model, and dispatch any `Task`/`parallel` subagents on that model. Routing off or no profile → honor the session model silently. Never fake a switch a tool can't make; skip routing on a one-line change.

## Read the room first (accompaniment dial)

Before asking anything, read `02-DOCS/wiki/harness/user-profile.md` for the technical level and accompaniment level, and adapt:

- **L0 "cavernícola"** — infer aggressively from the intent and any existing wiki/constitution. Ask only the questions whose answer would change the spec's scope. Draft, show, move on.
- **L1 "breve"** — one line of *why* per question; ask the few that genuinely matter.
- **L2 "explica decisiones"** — justify each requirement as you record it; surface the trade-offs you inferred.
- **L3 "acompañamiento total"** — explain what a spec is and is not, walk every section, ask freely (still one question at a time), confirm each answer before recording it. Ideal for non-technical users.

If no profile exists, default to non-technical framing and keep questions plain. Never assume fluency.

## Questioning discipline — one at a time, only where you can't infer

The failure mode of specs is the wall of twenty questions. Avoid it:

1. **Infer first.** Read the `constitution` (`02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/constitution.md`), the existing wiki, and sibling specs. Fill every section you reasonably can from what already exists.
2. **Ask only the gaps that change the spec.** A question earns its place only if a different answer would change scope, a goal, a user, or an acceptance criterion. Cosmetic gaps become *points to clarify*, not questions.
3. **One focused question per turn.** Ask, wait, record, then ask the next. Never batch. Phrase in the user's technical register.
4. **When inference and asking both fail, mark it.** Anything you cannot resolve in this pass becomes an explicit entry in *Points to clarify* — that list is the handoff contract to the `clarify` phase, not a defect.

Stop asking when the WHAT and WHY are complete enough to plan against. Remaining unknowns live in *Points to clarify*; you do not need every answer before writing the file.

## What a good spec contains

Write these sections into `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/specs/<slug>.md` using `references/spec-template.md`. Keep every line about behaviour and intent.

| Section | Holds | Watch for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Problem & why | The pain, the cost of not solving it, the trigger | A "solution" disguised as a problem |
| Goals | What success delivers, in outcome terms | A "goal" that's actually a HOW |
| Non-goals / out of scope | What is explicitly NOT done now — adjacent work, deferred features | Silence — unsaid scope becomes assumed scope |
| Users & context | Who acts, their context, what they're trying to achieve | An imagined user no one asked for |
| Behaviour | What the system does, in observable terms, incl. main + edge + error paths | A verb that's actually a HOW ("queries", "caches") |
| Acceptance criteria | Testable, binary checks that say "done" | Vague critera ("works well", "is fast") |
| Points to clarify | Open questions, assumptions made, decisions deferred | Pretending there are none |

### Acceptance criteria carry the weight

Each criterion is a binary, observable statement — true or false, no judgement call — phrased so `verify` can later check it and `tasks` can derive a done-check from it. Prefer the **Given / When / Then** shape; it forces a concrete trigger and a concrete outcome.

```text
Given a signed-in user with an empty cart
When they open the checkout page
Then they see an empty-cart message and the "pay" button is disabled
```

A criterion that needs a human to "decide if it's good enough" is not done yet — sharpen it or move the soft part to *Points to clarify*.

## The pass, end to end

Run these in order. It is a collaborative dialogue, not a form you fill in silence — and **you do not skip to a design dump.** Track the steps with a todo list so none is dropped.

```text
1. EXPLORE context        → profile + sdd config + constitution + existing specs + wiki + recent git
2. SCOPE check            → if the request is several independent subsystems, DECOMPOSE into sub-specs first,
                            then brainstorm the FIRST one; each gets its own spec → plan → build cycle
3. RESTATE in one sentence→ confirm you understood the intent before anything else
4. ASK, one at a time     → only the gaps that change scope; multiple-choice when you can; wait, record, repeat
5. PROPOSE 2-3 approaches → distinct directions with honest trade-offs; lead with your recommendation and why
6. PRESENT the design     → section by section (problem, users, behaviour, acceptance), scaled to complexity;
                            after EACH section ask "does this look right?" and adjust before moving on
7. WRITE the spec         → 02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/specs/<slug>.md (WHAT/WHY), index it in CLAUDE.md, commit if a repo
8. SELF-REVIEW            → scan for TODO/placeholder, contradictions, ambiguity, scope creep; fix inline
9. USER APPROVES          → ask them to read the written spec and confirm; loop on changes until they approve
10. HAND OFF              → only now, result envelope → clarify/plan. NEVER to implement.
```

**The gate is steps 5-9, and it is the point of this skill.** Implementation does not begin — not `plan`-to-code, not a stack skill, not "just a quick version" — until the user has approved the design at step 9. This holds for **every** feature, including ones that feel too small to design; "too simple to spec" is exactly where unexamined assumptions cost the most. The only thing that skips the loop is a literal one-line, zero-risk change (a typo, a copy tweak) — name it as such and do it.
```

`<slug>` is a short kebab-case name derived from the feature (e.g. `bulk-csv-import`, `magic-link-login`). If a spec with that slug exists, read it and update rather than overwrite.

## Worked shape (abridged)

```markdown
# Spec — Magic-link login

## Problem & why
Password resets are the #1 support ticket and a sign-up drop-off point.
A passwordless email link removes the password entirely.

## Goals
- A user can sign in with only their email, via a one-time link.
- No password is ever stored or required.

## Non-goals / out of scope
- Social login (Google/Apple) — deferred.
- Replacing existing sessions for already-signed-in users.

## Users & context
A returning user on a new device who does not remember a password.

## Behaviour
- Main: user enters email → receives a link → following it signs them in.
- Edge: an expired link shows a "request a new link" path.
- Error: an unknown email reveals nothing (same response as a known one).

## Acceptance criteria
- Given a registered email, When the user requests a link and follows it within
  its validity window, Then they are signed in.
- Given an expired link, When it is followed, Then sign-in is refused and a new
  link can be requested.

## Points to clarify
- Link validity window? (assumed: short, exact value deferred to clarify)
- Rate-limit on requests per email? (deferred)
```

Note what is *absent*: no token format, no table, no email provider, no framework. Those are `plan`'s job.

## Optional proposal / pre-execution briefing

For a tiny feature, skip this. For ambiguous, architectural, high-risk, high-review-cost or research-heavy work, write a proposal before the spec:

```text
02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/proposals/<slug>.md
```

Proposal grammar:

```markdown
# Proposal — <slug>

## Problem
## Intent
## Scope / Non-scope
## Research input
## Alternatives considered
## Tradeoffs
## Risks
## Rollback
## Success criteria
## Recommendation
```

The proposal is allowed to mention options and tradeoffs; the spec that follows still stays WHAT/WHY. If research came from a transcript, doc, spike, or external briefing, cite it in `Research input` so the decision trail survives the chat.

## Anti-patterns → STOP

| If you're about to… | Reality / Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Name a framework, table, endpoint, or library | That's HOW. Strip it; describe the behaviour instead, or log the open question. |
| Dump 12 questions in one message | One focused question per turn. Infer the rest from the constitution and wiki. |
| Ask a question you could answer from the constitution | Read it first. Only ask what genuinely changes the spec. |
| Write "it should work well / be fast / be intuitive" | Not testable. Make it a binary Given/When/Then or move it to Points to clarify. |
| Skip the whole loop because "this is too simple to design" | That's the rationalization that wastes the most work. Every feature gets the loop; only a literal one-line, zero-risk change skips. |
| Present one approach as the answer | Offer 2-3 distinct directions with trade-offs and a recommendation; let the user choose before you write the spec. |
| Hand to `plan`/`implement` before the user approved the written spec | The approval at step 9 is the gate. No design approved → nothing gets built. |
| Skip non-goals because "it's obvious" | Unsaid scope becomes assumed scope. State what you are *not* doing. |
| Resolve every ambiguity yourself to look finished | Inventing answers is worse than naming gaps. List them in Points to clarify. |
| Start designing the solution because it's clearer | Stay on WHAT/WHY. The plan is a later, separate phase. |
| Write the spec somewhere other than 02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/specs/ | That's the canonical location the rest of the chain reads. Use it. |

## Project grounding (02-DOCS + CLAUDE.md)

- Read `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/config.yaml` if present. If it is missing and the change is non-trivial, recommend `sdd-init` before proceeding; if the user asks to continue, record the missing config as a risk.
- Read `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/constitution.md` first — its principles are inherited constraints, not things to re-decide. If it's missing, note that the project has no constitution yet and suggest the `constitution` phase before continuing (you can still draft a spec, but flag the absence).
- **No constitution yet?** Still write the spec, but inherit nothing — lean harder on the wiki and the user's answers, and record every constraint you would have inherited as a *point to clarify* instead of assuming it.
- Write the spec to `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/specs/<slug>.md`. Create the directory if absent.
- Add a row under the `## Knowledge map` section of the root `CLAUDE.md` linking the new spec under the `sdd/specs` topic (additive only — never delete existing rows). Create `CLAUDE.md` if absent.
- Log the spec's creation and any significant scoping decision to `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/decisions.md` (append-only), so the chain keeps a trace of why scope landed where it did. This is the canonical SDD decisions log shared with `constitution` and `plan` — not the harness's own `02-DOCS/wiki/harness/decisions.md`.

## Result envelope

End with:

```json result-envelope
{
  "status": "complete",
  "executive_summary": "Spec written with open points ready for clarify.",
  "artifact": "02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/specs/<slug>.md",
  "next_recommended": "clarify",
  "risk": "low|medium|high",
  "skill_resolution": {
    "used": ["specify"],
    "missing": [],
    "fallback": [],
    "compact_rules": ["Keep specs WHAT/WHY only.", "Acceptance criteria must be observable."]
  },
  "evidence": ["spec path exists", "proposal path if used", "open points listed"]
}
```

## Next in the chain

A spec is the input to **`clarify`**, not the finish line. End by pointing there:

> "Spec written to `02-DOCS/wiki/sdd/specs/<slug>.md` with N open points. Next: run **`clarify`** to resolve them and de-risk the spec before planning."

If `clarify` surfaces answers, they get baked back into this same spec file. Only once the spec is de-risked does `plan` derive the technical approach.
